# Codevember 2019 - 06 Music

This demo is a late submission to Codevember 2019 - 06 - Music. I created it while I was travelling from Hamburg to Frankfurt via Deutsche Bahn. 

It features a piano and a pink slimy blob analyzing Web Audio. The piano is implemented as a VanillaJS Web component as I wanted to learn more about it.

The plug at my seat did not work and I was running out of battery, so I had to be quick. The piano has some a11y issues; it is not keyboard accessible at the moment. Also, I wasn't able to test it on iOS/Safari yet

## Running it

* Use the github pages link: https://terabaud.github.io/codevember-music/
* locally: `npm install` and `npm start` runs a minimal express web server
